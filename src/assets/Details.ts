    <br /><br />
    My skillset is quite diverse! I'm proficient in programming languages, frameworks like **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Flutter**, **Kotlin**, **Matlab**, **Shell/Bash**, **Docker**. But that's not all! I've also worked in **Machine learning**, **Deep Learning**,  and **Cybersecurity**, using tools like **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **PyTorch** to develop intelligent applications.
    <br /><br />
    Also I have rich experiences in using **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Microsoft Azure**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Ansible**.
    <br /><br />
    Of course, my career hasn't been all smooth sailing. Adapting to new technologies and meeting deadlines can be tough.

I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects that push my abilities and help me grow professionally. In the past, I've led a team in developing several AI applications that boosted user engagement and completed several projects that tackled real-world problems.`,
